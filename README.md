# Ice-Cream-Parlor
This code solves the Ice Cream Parlor problem by finding two distinct ice cream flavors whose costs sum to a given amount. It uses a dictionary to store costs and their indices, checking for the complement (target minus current cost) during iteration. When a valid pair is found, it returns their 1-based index in ascending order, ensuring optimal O(n) time complexity.
